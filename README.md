# Hi, I'm Ali 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻


I am a software engineer passionate since 2006, Have been involved in various projects with various technologies like PHP, Python, JavaScript, NodeJS, VueJS, MySQL and MongoDB.
And Believe it or not, I love to code. I find it enjoyable. I love building solutions that can be extended with only a few keystrokes, I like looking back at old code and refactoring away the nasty bits in order to transform into something great.
